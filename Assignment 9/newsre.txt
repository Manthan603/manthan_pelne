As i write this article, it makes me extremely proud as i have witnessed the best performance i have seen from team india in an overseas test tour in the last 20-25 years. Of course, we defeated the australia 2-1 in 2018, but the motivation with which this indian team has played is at another level. They have defeated australia 2-1 with almost a b side, and this also included a win a fortress gabba. 

To recap, team india were tormented in the first test match and that left them mentally exhausted at the end of the first test match. Post that, they were left without their captain, from the 2nd test onwards, their key first-choice players like mohammed shami, ishant sharma, umesh yadav, and ravindra jadeja had to withdraw because of injuries. Even ravichandran ashwin, jasprit bumrah, and hanuma vihari suffered injuries to miss out the final test.
With all these factors, ajinkya rahane led the side with supreme confidence. He managed his limited-resources in a brilliant fashion, and his captaincy is something that deserves a much-deserved appreciation. Kudos also to team india’s coach, ravi shastri, who played an important role behind the scenes to instil the much-needed motivation in the indian team.
